Saturnarian Settlers is our solution entry for the 2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge, [Titan City, 3023](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/titan-city-3023/). The goal of this challenge is to create an educational game that teaches the challenges of exploring and inhabiting Saturn's largest moon, [Titan](https://science.nasa.gov/saturn/moons/titan/facts/).

## Back Story
After much planning and preparation, it is finally time for the Titan 3023 crew, the Saturnian Settlers, to execute the mission. The Saturnian Settlers have landed on Titan, Saturn's icy moon, with the intentions to establish human settlements and advance society through exploration. 

Each round of Mission: Titan 3023 has different priorities but it is up to the Saturnian Settler’s decision makers to decide what choices are made at each phase to sustain human life on a Saturnian satellite. 

Space exploration is controlled by a global alliance called the Consolidated Earth Space Agencies of Earth (CESA). CESA provides the funding from its member states and has seeded the settlement mission by launching a series of rockets containing the essential settlement structures needed to bootstrap the settlement. They have also secured funding for seven supply missions to provide critical resources and additional settlers to the settlement.

The game is set in the far future. Humanity has overcome many of the challenges they faced in the early industrial and technology ages. Our settlers live in a time where science and technology have advanced sufficiently to enable discovery and exploration of the solar system. Society on Earth and the inner planets are still challenged by the issues we face today where politics, personalities, and nature keep life interesting.

Our settlers are about to embark on the journey of a lifetime to Titan where they intend to establish the first human settlement beyond the asteroid belt! Will they succeed? Their fate lies in your hands and in the choices you make on production and resource allocation both on Earth and within the settlement. Good luck! 

## Game Objective
Saturnian Settlers is a turn-based space mission simulation game designed for 1-4 players. The goal is to provide an entertaining experience while educating players on the challenges faced by settlers trying to establish a self-sustainable colony on a distant moon or planet. Our destination is Titan, one of the major moons orbiting Saturn. It is played over a number of rounds.
